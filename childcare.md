<p class="big-lead">We offer free childcare for the duration of the SRCCON:POWER program and welcome families of all sizes.</p>

We are offering free childcare throughout the full SRCCON:POWER schedule (including Thursday evening). Our providers are the wonderful [KiddieCorp](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/) team, whom we&rsquo;ve worked with for five SRCCON events!

## Our care providers

Staff-to-child ratios range from 1:2 for children 6-11 months to 1:7 for children aged 6-12 years, and KiddieCorp will work with SRCCON organizers to handle registration and logistics so your kid(s) can have a great time while you&rsquo;re conferencing. All caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education.

Two of our own staff members have had their young children happily in KiddieCorp&rsquo;s care and we were all impressed by the thoughtfulness they brought to every aspect of their services.

## Logistics

Childcare will take place at the conference hotel, which is a few blocks away from the conference venue. Registration will open soon. There&rsquo;s an option on the call for participation form to tell us you&rsquo;d like more information when registration opens, or you can [email us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) anytime. You can also [learn more about KiddieCorp&rsquo;s staffing](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/staffselect.html) and [security procedures](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/security.html).
