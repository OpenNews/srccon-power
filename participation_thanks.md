# Thank You for Answering the SRCCON:POWER Call for Participation!

If you proposed a session idea, we'll be reading it through soon, and if you let us know about some other way you'd like to participate at SRCCON:POWER or you asked about scholarships, we'll follow up with you!

Here are a couple of key dates coming up in the SRCCON:POWER process:

* The call for participation closes at 11:59pm ET, **Wednesday, Oct. 17**.
* We'll notify everyone about attendance (and session proposals, if you submitted one) by **October 31**.

Do you have a colleague who would be interested in or benefit from joining us in Philadelphia on December 13 & 14? Please ask them to apply! We hugely appreciate help reaching beyond our own networks, and personal recommendations have been a major part of what helps new folks find out about our events and bring more people into the community.

**Reminder to session proposers:** Because SRCCON:POWER is a collaborative, peer-to-peer event, we ask that all participants buy a ticket. We'll reserve a ticket for purchase by facilitators of accepted sessions.

You can send any additional session proposals to us at [srccon@opennews.org](mailto:srccon@opennews.org)â€”no need to fill out the form a second time.
