# Thank You for Answering the SRCCON:POWER Call for Participation!

We're so excited that you want to participate at SRCCON:POWER, and we&rsquo;ll follow up with you soon! By the end of October, if we've heard from you, you'll hear back from usâ€”and we'll continue to review attendee applications as they come in after that.

Do you have a colleague who would be interested in or benefit from joining us in Philadelphia on December 13 & 14? Please ask them to apply! The deadline for session proposals and scholarship applications is past, but we&rsquo;ll keep the form open for attendees as long as we can.

We hugely appreciate help reaching beyond our own networks. Personal recommendations have been a major part of what helps new folks find out about our events and bring more people into the community.
