<p>SRCCON:POWER and OpenNews are committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free environment for participants of all races, gender and trans statuses, sexual orientations, physical abilities, physical appearances, and beliefs. We’ve written this code of conduct not because we expect bad behavior from our community—which, in our experience, is overwhelmingly kind and civil—but because we believe a clear code of conduct is one necessary part of building a respectful community space.</p>

<p>SRCCON:POWER participants agree to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.</li>
  <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert any member of the conference team in person, via the team phone/text line, or via email.</li>
  <li>Take care of each other. Alert a member of the conference team if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</li>
</ul>

<p>If any attendee engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the conference. (If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should contact the conference team with a concise description of your grievance; any grievances filed will be considered by the entire OpenNews team.)</p>

<p>This code of conduct covers all of SRCCON:POWER, including evening activities. During SRCCON:POWER, we will publicize a contact email and phone number, in addition to pointing out the staff in matching t-shirts so you know who to contact if you see or experience an issue.
We welcome your feedback on this and every other aspect of SRCCON:POWER, and we thank you for working with us to make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates.</p>

            <h3>About SRCCON events</h3>
            <p>OpenNews runs several journalism events each year. The largest is <a href="https://srccon.org">SRCCON</a>, a mid-year conference for about 300 developers, designers, and data analysts. We also gather small working groups and topically focused SRCCON-style events. The &ldquo;src&rdquo; in SRCCON stands for &ldquo;Source,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;view source.&rdquo; We pronounce it &ldquo;Source-con,&rdquo; but you can say it however you want.</p>
            <h3>About OpenNews</h3>
            <p>OpenNews connects a network of developers, designers, journalists and editors to collaborate on open technologies and processes within journalism. OpenNews believes that a community of peers working, learning and solving problems together can create a stronger, more responsive, and ascendant journalism ecosystem. Incubated at the Mozilla Foundation from 2011-2016, OpenNews is now a project of Community Partners.</p>
