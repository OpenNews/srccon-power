<p>We don’t want cost to prevent you from coming to SRCCON:POWER, which is why we work to keep ticket prices low. To help defray the cost of attending SRCCON:POWER, OpenNews also offers a limited number of travel scholarships. Whether you’re a newsroom developer at a small organization with a strained professional development budget or a freelance developer eager to learn more about journalism code, we want to help you attend.</p>

<p>You do not have to fill out a separate application to apply. Scholarship questions are part of our <a href="/participation/form">call for participation form</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-were-offering">What We’re Offering</h2>
<p>A ticket to SRCCON:POWER and $500 for you to use toward the cost of travel to the event. (For scholarship recipients who live in the Philadelphia area, we offer a SRCCON:POWER ticket without the additional travel funding.)</p>

<h2 id="who-should-apply">Who Should Apply</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Anyone who is part of the journalism code community</li>
  <li>Anyone interested in learning more about the journalism code community</li>
  <li>People of color, women, and other underrepresented groups in technology are strongly encouraged to apply</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to Apply</h2>
<p>Select the “Would you like to be considered for a SRCCON:POWER scholarship?” option on the application <a href="/participation/form">call for participation form</a>. A few scholarship-specific questions will pop onto the form.</p>

<h2 id="when-notifications-go-out">When Notifications Go Out</h2>
<p>Notifications for scholarships will go out alongside other notifications as part of the call for participation.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-after-srcconpower">What Happens After SRCCON:POWER</h2>
<p>You tell us how it went! We’ll send you a short followup survey and will be excited to check out any blog posts or code repos that come out of your participation at SRCCON:POWER.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-you-offering-this-scholarship">Why are you offering this scholarship?</h2>
<p>We want to make sure that SRCCON:POWER is an event that includes the diversity of the communities we serve—geographically, demographically, experientially, and more. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-decide-who-will-receive-a-scholarship">How do you decide who will receive a scholarship?</h2>
<p>OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities under-represented in journalism and technology and from smaller and non-coastal newsrooms.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-still-need-to-purchase-a-ticket-to-srcconpower">Do I still need to purchase a ticket to SRCCON:POWER?</h2>
<p>If you receive a scholarship, you will not have to purchase a ticket.</p>

<h2 id="when-will-i-receive-my-scholarship">When will I receive my scholarship?</h2>
<p>When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship funds. In short, you will need to fill out a form and send some tax paperwork for our administrators to process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-need-more-than-500-for-my-travel">What if I need more than $500 for my travel?</h2>
<p>We’re able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. Luckily, Philadelphia is a relatively cheap city once you arrive. Also, this entire site runs <a href="https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon-power">off a Github repo</a>, so if you say, wanted to add a link to a room-share board, you could go right ahead and do that. Or, you can <a href="mailto:erika@opennews.org">email with any suggestions</a>.</p>

            <h3>About SRCCON events</h3>
            <p>OpenNews runs several journalism events each year. The largest is <a href="https://srccon.org">SRCCON</a>, a mid-year conference for about 300 developers, designers, and data analysts. We also gather small working groups and topically focused SRCCON-style events. The &ldquo;src&rdquo; in SRCCON stands for &ldquo;Source,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;view source.&rdquo; We pronounce it &ldquo;Source-con,&rdquo; but you can say it however you want.</p>
            <h3>About OpenNews</h3>
            <p>OpenNews connects a network of developers, designers, journalists and editors to collaborate on open technologies and processes within journalism. OpenNews believes that a community of peers working, learning and solving problems together can create a stronger, more responsive, and ascendant journalism ecosystem. Incubated at the Mozilla Foundation from 2011-2016, OpenNews is now a project of Community Partners.</p>
