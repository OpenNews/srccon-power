<p>From the airport, you can get to Old City by regional rail train. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Q2D8TiDEW322">Take the Airport Line to the Jefferson Station</a>, then walk a block to the 11st Street Station and take the blue line to 5th Street Independence Hall (or just walk about 8 blocks to the hotel or conference venue). A one-way fare on the Airport Line is $8.</p>

<p>For those coming from the Amtrak train, the blue line station is just next to the station on Market Street.</p>

<p>Numerous bus lines also run on Market Street, which is one block north of the venue. In addition to public transit, the Old City area is exceptionally walkable and cabs are plentiful.</p>

            <p>OpenNews runs several journalism events each year. The largest is <a href="https://srccon.org">SRCCON</a>, a mid-year conference for about 300 developers, designers, and data analysts. We also gather small working groups and topically focused SRCCON-style events. The &ldquo;src&rdquo; in SRCCON stands for &ldquo;Source,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;view source.&rdquo; We pronounce it &ldquo;Source-con,&rdquo; but you can say it however you want.</p>
