<p>SRCCON:POWER is a small conference with a program that digs deeply into how power animates our work and decisionmaking at the intersection of journalism and technology. It builds on the collaborative, peer-driven conference <a href="https://srccon.org">SRCCON</a>, where over five years we have brought hundreds of members of the news-code community together for hands-on sessions exploring the cultural and technical ideas that push journalism forward. Our events attract the best newsroom developers, designers, and data analysts for two days of thinking, working, and building together.</p>

<p>Sponsors help us make SRCCON:POWER unique and accessible by keeping our ticket price well below cost, getting people to the event, and bringing in the special touches that make SRCCON… SRCCON.</p>

<p>We offer several levels of sponsorship in order to accommodate a variety of sizes of companies and organizations. Below you’ll see some of our recent offerings. These may evolve as we plan for this unique event, but this will give you an idea of the type of sponsorships we may offer. <a href="mailto:erika@opennews.org">Email us</a> to talk about options!</p>

<h2 id="partnership-sponsors">Partnership Sponsors</h2>

<p>Our partnership sponsors are core supporters who make everything about SRCCON:POWER possible. Partnership Sponsorship may include:</p>

<p>Partnership Sponsors also take part in SRCCON:POWER, but not by sitting behind a booth. Instead, Partnership Sponsors attend and participate right alongside everyone else.
