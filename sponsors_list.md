    <p>The News Integrity Initiative at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism is a project to improve people’s lives by building trust in journalism, combating disinformation, and nurturing constructive, inclusive and respectful public conversations. Through grants, applied research, events and workshops, we provide support for journalism that listens, responds to, and meaningfully reflects the needs and goals of the communities it serves. Our vision is for people to feel powerful — to feel visible, valued, and engaged in their communities — because they are armed with news and information that strengthens their sense of ownership and opportunities in the places where they live and work, empowers them to participate in community decision-making, and deepens their understanding of and empathy for people of all backgrounds and experiences.</p>
