SRCCON:POWER is a two-day conference on December 13 & 14 to investigate how power operates in our newsrooms, in our relationships with communities, and in the algorithms and technologies that are reshaping our work. Through talks and hands-on sessions, 125 participants will work together to understand the power and responsibility we have in using technology to inform and engage.

This event builds on [SRCCON 2018](https://2018.srccon.org/schedule/), which included many sessions on journalism&rsquo;s relationship with communities, and [SRCCON:WORK](https://work.srccon.org/), about how we support each other and collaborate within newsrooms. With SRCCON:POWER, we&rsquo;ll explore the dynamics that underly these relationships as well as how power informs decisionmaking within design and development.

Participants will leave with a deepened understanding of power at a technological, organizational, and societal level, as well as strategies for how we can strengthen our collective work to make journalism more equitable.

## When & where

December 13-14 in Philadelphia, at the [Science History Museum](https://www.sciencehistory.org) (formerly the Chemical Heritage Foundation, home of SRCCON:WORK and SRCCON 2014).

## Who participates and how?

This is an event for anyone interested in better understanding how power operates at the intersection of journalism and tech. We&rsquo;re looking for folks with insights—gathered through research, life experience, or otherwise—in how power structures influence the work and efficacy of journalism. Participants will have the opportunity to spend two days with colleagues who are interested in increasing equity and bringing transparency to the systems of power that inform journalism and how we approach this work.

If you&rsquo;ve been to SRCCON before, have never been, or have never even heard of SRCCON, we&rsquo;re excited for you to participate! We will invite folks to attend the event through a call for participation application form, which will be where participants can pitch sessions, apply for need-based scholarships, and suggest any other ways they&rsquo;d like to participate. If you&rsquo;re interested in attending but need to put in a request to attend with your organization right away, just [drop us a line](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) and we&rsquo;ll see how we can help. Once we launch our application form, we&rsquo;ll let you know when you can expect a response from us, aiming to reply to folks as quickly as we can.

## How much does it cost?

Tickets will cost $225, plus ticketing fees.

## What&rsquo;s next?

We&rsquo;ll announce the call for participation application dates by the end of September, as we plan out the full shape and schedule for the event.
