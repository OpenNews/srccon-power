## About SRCCON:POWER

SRCCON:POWER is a two-day conference on December 13 & 14 to investigate how power operates in our newsrooms, in our relationships with communities, and in the algorithms and technologies that are reshaping our work. Through talks and hands-on sessions, 125 participants will work together to understand the power and responsibility we have in using technology to inform and engage.

This event builds on [SRCCON 2018](https://2018.srccon.org/schedule/), which included many sessions on journalism&rsquo;s relationship with communities, and [SRCCON:WORK](https://work.srccon.org/), about how we support each other and collaborate within newsrooms. With SRCCON:POWER, we&rsquo;ll explore the dynamics that underly these relationships as well as how power informs decision-making within design and development.

Participants will leave with a deepened understanding of power at a technological, organizational, and societal level, as well as strategies for how we can strengthen our collective work to make journalism more equitable.

## Who participates and how?

This is an event for anyone interested in better understanding how power operates at the intersection of journalism and tech. We&rsquo;re looking for folks with insights—gathered through research, life experience, or otherwise—in how power structures influence the work and efficacy of journalism. Participants will have the opportunity to spend two days with colleagues who are interested in increasing equity and bringing transparency to the systems of power that inform journalism and how we approach this work.

If you&rsquo;ve been to SRCCON before, have never been, or have never even heard of SRCCON, we&rsquo;re excited for you to participate! Our call for participation form is now closed.
