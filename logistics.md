## Venue

SRCCON:POWER will take place at the [Science History Institute](https://www.sciencehistory.org/), a museum and event space in the Old City neighborhood of Philadelphia.

## Schedule

**Dates:** December 13 & 14

We're still finalizing details, but your travel plans can anticipate the SRCCON:POWER program beginning around 9am on Thursday, Dec. 13, and closing around 6pm on Friday, Dec. 14.

## Hotel

We have a discounted block of rooms at the Wyndham Philadelphia Historic District Hotel a few blocks from the conference venue. The nightly rate will be $179 plus taxes. 

Online booking is no longer available for the hotel, but you can call Samena at the Wyndham (267-765-3345) and let her know you are part of the SRCCON group to receive the discount rate. The rate will be available until the hotel is sold out.

## Childcare

We offer free childcare throughout the full SRCCON:POWER schedule (including Thursday dinner) at the nearby Wyndham Hotel. The caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education.
