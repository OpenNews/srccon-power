## Hotel

We have a discounted block of rooms at the [Wyndham Philadelphia Historic District Hotel](https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/wyndham/philadelphia-pennsylvania/wyndham-philadelphia-historic-district/overview) a few blocks from the conference venue. The nightly rate will be $179 plus taxes.

Online booking is no longer available for the hotel, but you can call Samena at the Wyndham (267-765-3345) and let her know you are part of the SRCCON group to receive the discount rate. The rate will be available until the hotel is sold out.

## Getting Around Philly

The Old City neighborhood is accessible via bus and subway on public transit. The local transit organization is [SEPTA](http://septa.org/). The closest subway station to the conference hotel and venue is [5th Street Independence Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/Z6xmt8m5c7E2) on the Market-Frankford Line (also known as “the El” or “blue line”). You can buy a [refillable Key Card](http://www.septa.org/fares/pass/key.html) from kiosks at stations, or even single-ride tokens at some stations as well.

From the airport, you can get to Old City by regional rail train. [Take the Airport Line to the Jefferson Station](https://goo.gl/maps/Q2D8TiDEW322), then walk a block to the 11st Street Station and take the blue line to 5th Street Independence Hall (or just walk about 8 blocks to the hotel or conference venue). A one-way fare on the Airport Line is $8.

For those coming from the Amtrak train, the blue line station is just next to the station on Market Street.

Numerous bus lines also run on Market Street, which is one block north of the venue. In addition to public transit, the Old City area is exceptionally walkable and cabs are plentiful.
