Everyone at SRCCON:POWER contributes to making it happen. Our [call for participation form](/participation/form) is now open with questions about attending, pitching a session, and applying for a scholarship. We'll send out invitations to participate by the end of April.

# Participation at SRCCON

SRCCON:POWER is a hands-on conference, which means that everyone who attends actively participates throughout the event. We [are excited to hear about](/participation/form) what you'd like to share, whether that be as a facilitator or attendee, and what you hope to take back home with you. 

We keep the size of SRCCON:POWER intentionally small, at about 125 participants. This size means we need to be intentional about equitably distributing tickets and ensuring that there are a mix of perspectives and skills at SRCCON:POWER. Our call for participation form will help us understand who would like to take part and what you want to get out of it. With those responses, we'll work to create a schedule and audience that reflects the dynamic interests and needs of this community.

The form is open until 11:59pm ET on October 17. After that, we will review entries and notify everyone by the end of October. If invited to attend, you will have the chance to purchase a ticket for $225, plus fees. 

## Not Just Attendees, But Participants

At SRCCON:POWER, everyone participates in some way. [Our hands-on sessions rely on participants](/sessions/about) who are ready to share their experiences and perspectives. [Facilitators create space](/sessions/about#facilitators) for in-depth conversations, design exercises, demos, and workshops, and participants bring questions and take ideas back to their newsrooms. In addition to sessions, folks help make SRCCON:POWER an inclusive, welcoming place by leading fun group activities like knitting or book clubs, volunteering, and saying hi to new potential friends and collaborators over meals and coffee/tea/hot beverages.

We'll have a few questions for you about what you'd like to bring to SRCCON:POWER and what you're hoping to take home with you. We look forward to seeing what ideas folks have and how we can make them possible during our two days together.

## Facilitating Sessions

At SRCCON events, session facilitators regularly make up more than a third of attendees. All of our sessions are peer-led by conference attendeesâ€”consider becoming a facilitator this year by [learning more about sessions](/sessions/about). You will be able to tell us all about your session idea on the call for participation form.

## Welcome, First-timers

We think SRCCON events are best when there's a mix of new folks and veterans. And we want new folks to feel able to participate in whatever ways interest you. There's a spot on [the form](/participation/form)  to ask for more information if you're interested in attending but not quite sure how you want to participate. In reviewing forms, we'll aim to have a healthy mix of newcomers and returning SRCCON participants. So SRCCON alums, you can put your name in without worrying that you're taking a new attendee's spot.

## Financial & Family Assistance

We have a limited number of [travel scholarships](/scholarships) available to help people who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend. To apply for a scholarship to SRCCON:POWER, just let us know on the [call for participation form](/participation/form).

In addition to financial assistance, we know that making sure you have coverage for your children is important, so we also offer attendees free childcare run by providers we've trusted with our own kids for years. We'll have more details about that soon, and there's also a question on the form to let us know you'd like all the info about childcare.
