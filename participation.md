# Participation at SRCCON:POWER

SRCCON:POWER is a hands-on conference, which means that everyone who attends actively participates throughout the event.

Participation at SRCCON:POWER is about building on work that attendees are already doing to shift and understand power dynamics. It&rsquo;s about taking time to support one another and figure out how we keep ourselves and our work moving into 2019 and beyond.

We&rsquo;re grateful to have two days to spend together to support one another in getting through to the end of a tough year.

Power is a vast topic, and luckily many people in this community understand that we have a responsibility to understand power dynamics and thoughtfully wield the power we have as journalists. At SRCCON:POWER, we have space to focus on how we can work collectively to shift power dynamics at the intersection of journalism and tech. We want to build plans, devise strategies, and use this time to further strengthen work that's already happening to increase equity and inclusion in journalism.

*You* probably are already a part of this work, whether it be through unionizing your newsroom, participating in journalism groups, organizing your own spaces for support like the JOC Slack and Lonely Coders Club, or fielding questions from colleagues. Our call for participation form is now closed. Sometimes there are last-minute cancellations though, so feel free to [email us](mailto:srccon@openews.org) to see if any tickets have become available.

## Not Just Attendees, But Participants

At SRCCON:POWER, everyone participates in some way. [Our hands-on sessions rely on participants](/sessions/about) who are ready to share their experiences and perspectives. [Facilitators create space](/sessions/about#facilitators) for in-depth conversations, design exercises, demos, and workshops, and participants bring questions and take ideas back to their newsrooms. In addition to sessions, folks help make SRCCON:POWER an inclusive, welcoming place by leading fun group activities like knitting or book clubs, volunteering, and saying hi to new potential friends and collaborators over meals and coffee/tea/hot beverages.

We&rsquo;ll have a few questions for you about what you&rsquo;d like to bring to SRCCON:POWER and what you&rsquo;re hoping to take home with you. We look forward to seeing what ideas folks have and how we can make them possible during our two days together.

## Inviting Participants and Allocating Tickets

We keep the size of SRCCON:POWER intentionally small, at about 125 participants. This size means we need to be intentional about equitably distributing tickets and ensuring that there are a mix of perspectives and skills at SRCCON:POWER. Our call for participation form will help us understand who would like to take part and what you want to get out of it. With those responses, we&rsquo;ll work to create a schedule and audience that reflects the dynamic interests and needs of this community.

Our call for participation form is now closed. Sometimes there are last-minute cancellations though, so feel free to [email us](mailto:srccon@openews.org) to see if any tickets have become available. If invited to attend, you will have the chance to purchase a ticket for $225 plus fees.

## Facilitating Sessions

At SRCCON events, session facilitators regularly make up more than a third of attendees. All of our sessions are peer-led by conference attendees.

## Welcome, First-timers

We think SRCCON events are best when there&rsquo;s a mix of new folks and veterans. And we want new folks to feel able to participate in whatever ways interest you. In reviewing forms, we&rsquo;ll aim to have a healthy mix of newcomers and returning SRCCON participants. So SRCCON alums, you can put your name in without worrying that you&rsquo;re taking a new attendee&rsquo;s spot.

## Financial & Family Assistance

We allocated a limited number of [travel scholarships](/scholarships) available to help people who wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be able to attend. 

In addition to financial assistance, we know that making sure you have coverage for your children is important, so we also offer attendees free childcare run by providers we&rsquo;ve trusted with our own kids for years. We&rsquo;ll have more details about that soon, and there&rsquo;s also a question on the form to let us know you&rsquo;d like all the info about childcare.
