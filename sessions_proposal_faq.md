# Proposal FAQ

Are you thinking about [proposing a session](/participation/form) for SRCCON:POWER? We&rsquo;ll have your back throughout the entire process—before, during, and after the conference. Here are some answers to questions that might be on your mind right now, and if you&rsquo;re curious about anything else, [please let us know](mailto:srccon@opennews.org)!

## Key dates

* **October 26:** deadline for session proposals and scholarship applications
* **By October 31:** if we&rsquo;ve heard from you, you&rsquo;ll hear from us

## What if I _kind of_ have a session idea, but it&rsquo;s not fully formed yet?

That&rsquo;s completely OK! If you&rsquo;re excited about being part of the SRCCON:POWER program, we&rsquo;re excited to work with you to refine your topic. Successful sessions often emerge from a single question or problem—if you’ve been struggling with just about any aspect of your work, you can bet others have dealt with it, too. Until we publish this year&rsquo;s conference program, we&rsquo;re the only ones who&rsquo;ll see your session proposal, so you should feel free to talk about things at whatever level of detail you feel good about.

We don&rsquo;t consult a list of the latest trends to figure out which sessions to invite; we want SRCCON:POWER to be a place where passionate facilitators challenge us in ways that couldn&rsquo;t happen at any other conference. Whatever shape your ideas are taking, please [share them with us](/participation/form)! It&rsquo;s OK to say "I don&rsquo;t know exactly where to take this"—we&rsquo;d love to think it through with you.

## What kind of planning support is there for session facilitators?

If your session is selected, we&rsquo;ll support you during your entire planning process. That starts shortly after we announce the program, when we&rsquo;ll share [a Facilitator Guide that should look a lot like this one](https://srccon.org/facilitators/) (with a few tweaks specific to SRCCON:POWER).

We&rsquo;ll check in with you over the weeks leading up to SRCCON:POWER, asking about any supplies or scheduling needs you might have, making sure you&rsquo;re happy with your session name and description, and offering any feedback you need on the outline and activities you have planned. You&rsquo;ll get regular emails from us, but we&rsquo;re also always happy to jump on a call to talk through any questions or brainstorms that come up.

A couple weeks before the conference on December 13 & 14, we&rsquo;ll make sure you know the date and room for your session. And we&rsquo;ll offer a short facilitator training at the venue the night before SRCCON:POWER, where we can talk through a few facilitation tips, take a look at the rooms you&rsquo;ll be leading sessions in, and give you a chance to meet other session leaders.

We also believe that conferences like SRCCON:POWER are where amazing work only _begins_, so we&rsquo;re already thinking about ways to support you in moving ideas forward after your session is done.

## What&rsquo;s it like to lead a session at SRCCON:POWER, and how can I account for that in my session pitch?

You&rsquo;ll hear "participatory" and "collaborative" used a lot to describe SRCCON events, and we unpack a ton more about what that means on [our Sessions page](/sessions/about). As you&rsquo;re thinking about a proposal, some key points to guide you:

* Sessions last 60-75 minutes, so consider what you can realistically cover in that amount of time.
* The best session descriptions are clear and inviting, and describe an outcome that attendees can expect to accomplish.
* You&rsquo;ll be in a room with a bunch of other smart, engaged people, and no one expects you to have all the answers. Sometimes it&rsquo;s important just to bring the right questions!

## What happens when the conference is over?

One of the most exhilarating things for us as conference organizers is to see people go out and DO THE WORK. Maybe that&rsquo;ll be you, as a session leader, with newfound energy after talking through how you&rsquo;re trying to get your organization to see power in a different way. Maybe it&rsquo;s an attendee who learned something new in _your_ session, and takes home a plan to change their community&rsquo;s relationship with journalism. There are so many exciting things that can happen when passionate people get together at an event like SRCCON:POWER. And we want to help you plan for those outcomes! If there&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;d like to build together or move forward after the event is over, we&rsquo;re here to support that work. We just want you to tell us what you need.
