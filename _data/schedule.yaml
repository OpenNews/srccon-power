        "description": "Discussions of race, gender and power in journalism aren't new. In fact, some of the country's most dynamic journalists throughout history were resisters and activists, working outside of dominant power systems. This session is a dive into historical legacies of resistance in journalism, from known names like Ida B. Wells to lesser-known leaders like Marvel Cooke and Ruben Salazar. We'll look at strategies for building power from starting independent and community-based projects to union organizing, legal action, boycotts and protests. We'll connect these stories from the past to current-day strategies for transforming journalism and building the news we need today.  Facilitator Lewis Wallace is currently writing a book about the history of \"objectivity\" in journalism, through the stories of marginalized journalists who have pushed back, challenged, and changed journalism in the U.S. ",

When, how, and on what grounds can journalists challenge established pay practices? \n\nTo ground us, we'll briefly review, with examples, how journalism organizations have historically paid for labor, how journalists and their constituents have responded, and how the economy has changed over time. City Bureau will also share the universal (no negotiation) pay policy we created and the lessons we learned along the way. ",

This may come in the form of asking tough questions of leaders in public or private spaces, empowering people around us to speak up, or speaking directly on a more junior coworker's behalf. The transition to wielding authority as part of management changes that power dynamic from implicit to explicit. The same strategies may no longer apply: progress may be slow, public communication may be less splashy, action may be hampered by defined processes, and responsibility may shift from asking tough questions to delivering hard truths.

Where do you have opportunities to shift the balance of power?\n\nIn this off-the-record session, we want to:\n* Offer a snapshot of how foundations are thinking and talking about supporting journalism today\n* Share Dos and Don’ts for building relationships with funders\n* Help you understand what program directors and officers at foundations do and do not have control over\n* Brainstorm ways that funders could share more power with grantees and applicants, and how we might put some of those ideas into practice\n\nWe also want to:\n* Give you a chance to discuss sticky situations with funders and workshop ways to fix them\n* Offer a safe space to ask questions you’ve been afraid to ask, or share funding-related frustrations you want to talk through\n\nWe are two people who are very familiar with being both the funder and the grantee, seeking to build bridges between the two and reduce the power imbalance.

Participants at this session will learn how to build accountable and trustworthy relationships that are mutually beneficial to both the public and local media. We’ll share examples and strategies on how projects in North Carolina, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and rural Kentucky put community, not the newsroom, at the center of the work.
