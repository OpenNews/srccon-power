        "description": "In this session, I’d like to explore the idea of “family” within the workplace. In some ways, having a close personal working relationship with your colleagues builds trust, fosters greater collaboration and, in times of adversity, trauma or distress, allows for a level of comfort. In others, considering your co-workers as family can be detrimental. It opens doors for manipulation, open secrets and requires a level of vulnerability, which can be used against one another. At what level does a family-like environment help versus when does it start to hurt? What can we do to build these relationships in a productive manner while respecting workplace boundaries like separation of work and personal life? Finally, how can we prevent these boundaries from being crossed and the closeness from being manipulative?",

What are the best and worst lessons you’ve learned about how to work with people of different ages and experiences, and empower everyone to be their best selves at work?

And once you get funding, hanging onto it for more than a year or two seems like a never-ending battle.\n\nWhat should the ideal relationship look like between funders and organizations? Where do you have opportunities to shift the balance of power?\n\nIn this off-the-record session, we want to:\n* Offer a snapshot of how foundations are thinking and talking about supporting journalism today\n* Share Dos and Don’ts for building relationships with funders\n* Help you understand what program directors and officers at foundations do and do not have control over\n* Brainstorm ways that funders could share more power with grantees and applicants, and how we might put some of those ideas into practice\n\nWe also want to:\n* Give you a chance to discuss sticky situations with funders and workshop ways to fix them\n* Offer a safe space to ask questions you’ve been afraid to ask, or share funding-related frustrations you want to talk through\n\nWe are two people who are very familiar with being both the funder and the grantee, seeking to build bridges between the two and reduce the power imbalance.

In fact, some of the country's most dynamic journalists throughout history were resisters and activists, working outside of dominant power systems. This session is a dive into historical legacies of resistance in journalism, from known names like Ida B. Wells to lesser-known leaders like Marvel Cooke and Ruben Salazar. We'll look at strategies for building power from starting independent and community-based projects to union organizing, legal action, boycotts and protests. We'll connect these stories from the past to current-day strategies for transforming journalism and building the news we need today.

This may come in the form of asking tough questions of leaders in public or private spaces, empowering people around us to speak up, or speaking directly on a more junior coworker's behalf. The transition to wielding authority as part of management changes that power dynamic from implicit to explicit. The same strategies may no longer apply: progress may be slow, public communication may be less splashy, action may be hampered by defined processes, and responsibility may shift from asking tough questions to delivering hard truths.

        "description": "Many who have worked in newsrooms have been involved in conflicts. Often the interests of reporters can get overruled by people with more power in the organization. Or, fearing repercussions, or just running out of energy, one might back away from a fight. Still, the conversations that are part of building power to raise concerns, or the relationships and trust built as part of that, can be valuable, regardless of the outcome of the conflict. This session would use small groups with art-making supplies to make pages in a zine describing strategies for building power out of losing battles, or to be better able to recognize things that have been built when it feels like everything is falling apart.",

        "description": "After several weeks of Hurricane Maria news coverage last year, a poll found that only about half of Americans knew that Puerto Rico is part of the United States. Would that be different if news maps of the U.S. routinely showed Puerto Rico? What if election maps showed not just votes, but where people aren’t eligible to vote? We’ll take a look at examples of projects and redesigns that confront what we take for granted, and go through a few thought experiments to consider how small changes to templates, design defaults and data structures could improve newsrooms or better serve the public.",

This single data point has tremendous implications with how we have been trained as an audience to see 'the other' or those that don't identify in the same ways we do. This session will walk you through the origins the visual language, show examples of how we've been primed to devalue the lives of brown and black people and how by simply being aware of this dynamic, you can help correct the imbalance.",
