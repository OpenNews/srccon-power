## The SRCCON:POWER Program

SRCCON:POWER will explore how we as a community can make journalism more inclusive, representative, and responsive. This is a brand-new event where we'll spend two days exploring the power dynamics in journalism and technology. We want this program to:

* equip us to push for change, through building new resources and new capacity as a community, and by sharing information that helps us make the case for change when we get back home.
* help us make real plans for the weeks and months following SRCCON:POWER, and connect us with people who can support us in that work.

## Schedule Overview

Our schedule will include two types of sessions: [talks](#about-talks) that present research on power in newsrooms, communities, and tech; and participatory [sessions](#about-sessions) where small groups can dig deeper into those themes. We'll provide live transcription of the talks as they take place, and make sure breakout sessions are a space for more private conversations.

We'll publish our official schedule soon, but the overall days will be shaped approximately like this:

**Thursday, Dec. 13**

* **8am:** Registration and breakfast
* **9am:** Welcome
* **9:30am-12:30pm:** Talks, sessions & breaks
* **12:30-2pm:** Lunch at SRCCON:POWER
* **2-6pm:** Talks, sessions & breaks
* **Evening:** Small group dinners in Philly

**Friday, Dec. 14**

* **8:30am:** Breakfast
* **9:30am-1pm:** Talks, sessions & breaks
* **1-2:30pm:** Lunch at SRCCON:POWER
* **2-5pm:** Talks, sessions & breaks
* **5pm:** Closing

## A Schedule That Respects Community

SRCCON:POWER is organized around shared experiences. We build the schedule in way that prioritizes connecting with other participants and collaboration on plans to push for change in our organizations and communities.

We’ve built in generous breaks so that you can continue conversations without rushing to the next thing. Lunch as a group provides for space to rest, spend time with distant friends, or discuss new topics as they emerge. Dinner on Thursday evening will give you a chance to connect with people wrestling with the same problems you are.

We want SRCCON:POWER to feel less like a small conference and more like a big cohort. We hope you’ll find new colleagues, champions, collaborators in every space and leave SRCCON:POWER with new ideas _and_ new relationships. When you take on the work of bringing change to your newsroom, it helps to know you have a community supporting you.

## About Our Talks

Talks will open both our days at SRCCON:POWER, bring us back from lunch, and send us off to dinner on Thursday night. SRCCON events are all about participation and conversation, and these are no different—we'll get a chance to hear about research into the way power operates in our work, then follow up with time for Q&A. We've asked speakers to challenge us, because solutions to systemic problems won't come from the ways we've approached journalism in the past.

Our speakers at SRCCON:POWER will include:

* I'Nasah Crockett ([@so_treu](https://twitter.com/@so_treu))
* Robert Hernandez ([@webjournalist](https://twitter.com/@webjournalist))
* Brittany Paris ([@parisbrittany](https://twitter.com/@parisbrittany))
* Rachel Schallom ([@rschallom](https://twitter.com/@rschallom)) and Ben Mullin ([@benmullin](https://twitter.com/@benmullin))
* Sara Wachter-Boettcher ([@sara_ann_marie](https://twitter.com/sara_ann_marie))

## About Our Sessions

Sessions at SRCCON events are highly collaborative: an opportunity to compare notes, share skills, and take advantage of every attendee’s expertise. We learn best when we learn from each other, and we want you to share ideas and start projects that live on beyond this event.
