# Call for Participation

We can&rsquo;t wait to hear how you&rsquo;d like to participate at SRCCON:POWER! If you want to attend, facilitate a session, apply for a scholarship, or take part in some other way, this one form is where to let us know.

You can read a little more about [how we&rsquo;re thinking about participation](/participation) for this event, and how we&rsquo;re thinking about sessions in [our Proposal FAQ](/sessions/proposal-faq). A few things to know right now:

* We know that the topics at SRCCON:POWER may raise sensitive conversations that need care, trust, and privacy, so we won't be publishing proposals before we announce the program.
* OpenNews staff will review proposals, and may work with a small group of community volunteers to help with session selection.
* If there are any additional concerns you have or discretion you'd like us to take, you can tell us anything right when you fill out the call for participation.

Please feel free to [reach out to us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) with any questions, or if you&rsquo;re all set, the participation form below is open through October 17!
