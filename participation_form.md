# Call for Participation

We can’t wait to hear about how you would like to participate at SRCCON:POWER!

SRCCON:POWER is a hands-on conference, which means that everyone who attends actively participates throughout the event. Through this form, we want to hear all about how you'd like to participate, whether as an attendee or a facilitator, and you can tell us if you'd need a travel scholarship, too. There won’t be a separate ticket lottery or sale date, so if you want to come to SRCCON:POWER, this form is how to let us know.

Power is a vast topic, and luckily many people in this community understand that we have a responsibility to understand power dynamics and thoughtfully wield the power we have as journalists. We see these two days together as a space to focus on how we can work collectively to shift power dynamics at the intersection of journalism and tech. We want to build plans, devise strategies, and use this time to further strengthen existing work happening to increase equity and inclusion in journalism.

*You* probably are already a part of this work, whether it be through unionizing your newsroom, participating in journalism groups, organizing your own spaces for support like the JOC Slack and Lonely Coders Club, or fielding questions from colleagues. We want to hear about all of that and any projects or session ideas you'd like to bring to SRCCON:POWER. Let's see what we can do with two days together!

If you’re thinking about participating in SRCCON:POWER but you still have some questions on just what we’re looking for, [please reach out](mailto:srccon@opennews.org)! Or if you’re all set, the form is below!
